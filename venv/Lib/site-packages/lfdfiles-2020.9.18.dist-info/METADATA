Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) file formats
=======================================================

Lfdfiles is a Python library and console script for reading, writing,
converting, and viewing many of the proprietary file formats used to store
experimental data and metadata at the `Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics
<https://www.lfd.uci.edu/>`_. For example:

* SimFCS VPL, VPP, JRN, BIN, INT, CYL REF, BH, BHZ FBF, FBD, B64, I64, Z64, R64
* GLOBALS LIF, ASCII
* CCP4 MAP
* Vaa3D RAW
* Bio-Rad(r) PIC
* Vista IFLI
* FlimFast FLIF

For command line usage run ``python -m lfdfiles --help``

Notes
-----
Lfdfiles is currently developed, built, and tested on Windows only.

The API is not stable yet and might change between revisions.

The latest `Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017
and 2019 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/
the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_ is required on Windows.

Many of the LFD's file formats are not documented and might change arbitrarily.
This implementation is mostly based on reverse engineering existing files.
No guarantee can be made as to the correctness of code and documentation.

Experimental data are often stored in plain binary files with metadata
available in separate, human readable journal files (.jrn).

Unless specified otherwise, data are stored in little-endian, C contiguous
order.

Examples
--------

Create a Bio-Rad PIC file from a numpy array:

>>> data = numpy.arange(1000000).reshape(100, 100, 100).astype('u1')
>>> bioradpic_write('_biorad.pic', data)

Read the volume data from the PIC file as numpy array, and access metadata:

>>> with BioradPic('_biorad.pic') as pic:
...     data = pic.asarray()
...     pic.shape
...     pic.spacing
(100, 100, 100)
(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Convert the PIC file to a compressed TIFF file:

>>> BioradPic('_biorad.pic').totiff('_biorad.tif', compress=6)
